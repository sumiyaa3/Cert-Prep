                The kazoo is a rather unique instrument in that a person
                hums into it in order to get it to make noise.
            </p>
            <p>
                The kazoo is known as a membranophone instrument, which is a
                family of instruments to where a vibrating membrane makes
                the noise.

                The Kazoo originates in Africa
                and dates back hundreds of years.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kazoos can be made out of metal, plastic,
                or even through toilet paper tubes as a do-it-yourself project.

            <h6>Describe three main reasons for using the alt attribute.</h6>
            <p>a. One reason to use the alt tag is that it takes place of an image when it won't show up.</p>
            <p>b. It allows accesbility fo people who are unable to see the image so they rely on somone to read the alt text aloud</p>
            <p>c. It also allows search engines to understand the sight better since they cant exactly see the text so they rely on the alt text.</p>
